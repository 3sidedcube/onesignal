# Chelsea Apps Registry

This is a template library for Chelsea Apps NestJS packages.

### How to use

Create a new repo on GitHub and select this repository as the template. Clone your new repository, then run the setup script:

```bash
$ cd setup
$ npm i
$ node setup.js name
```

where `name` is the name of the package you wish to create.

This script will duplicate the `template` folder and fill out the template files with the new project name.

You can then delete both the `setup` and `template` folders.

#### Documentation

Documentation can be generated by running

```bash
npx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s
```

This will create a documentation folder and serve them locally.

This documentation can then be imported into [GitBook](https://app.gitbook.com/@chelseaapps/s/chelsea-apps/libraries/registry) by zipping the folder and importing it.
